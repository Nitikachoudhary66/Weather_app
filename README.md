User-Friendly Interface: The app has an intuitive design, making it easy to check weather details and navigate between options.
## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: For the front-end development.
Geolocation API: Used to retrieve the user's latitude and longitude to get location-specific weather data.

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. An API key is required to access the API. You can get your own key by signing up on the OpenWeatherMap website.

## How It Works
Location-based Weather: If the user grants location access, their coordinates are used to fetch weather data.
Search Weather: The user can search by city name to fetch weather details.
The app fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API using the coordinates or city name, and displays temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.
